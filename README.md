# Rick and Morty Project! 🚀

A wise person (me 😄) once said, "Even as a Web developer, you should create fun things to stay motivated to learn!" And what could be more fun than combining coding with the universe of Rick and Morty?

If you're a fan of the interdimensional adventures of Rick and Morty, love checking out character details, locations, episode appearances, and more, you've teleported to the right dimension!

A Fun Fact Before You Go 🎉
Initially, this project was set in the JavaScript dimension. But, just before styling, I decided to refactor it in TypeScript. Check out the original JavaScript repository [here](https://github.com/Sepidehatt/React-Rick-and-Morty).

Happy Exploring, Fellow Rick and Morty Fans!
